As California residents, we've witnessed the prevalence of wildfires all across the state, and decided to look at which factors contribute to and might predict the occurrence of a wildfire. Specifically, we looked at 20 counties in Northern California, and wildfires occurring rom 2018 to 2020, as they seem to be getting more intense and common in recent years.

Through our visualizations and analysis of the data, we found a statistically significant correlation between precipitation and temperature in wildfire occurrences, meaning that wildfires were most likely to occur during months with especially high temperatures and low levels of precipitation.
